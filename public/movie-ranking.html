<p>so it took a long time for me and maverick to stop yapping about this movie.we also had your name wallpapers in our mobiles and lap.and if i'm not wrong maverick still has them in his desktop.its a really nice theory and a movie all together. " mitsuka and taki". its a nice romantic story line and bascially we love romantic movies<3. </p>
